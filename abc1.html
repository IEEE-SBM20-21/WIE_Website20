            <h1 class="post-title">Top Five Women-Led Indian Start-ups</h1>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>In a world dominated by men, these women have shattered the glass ceiling by founding some of the most successful companies. These women that possess sharp entrepreneurial skills have battled stereotypes and have emerged victorious in business and are some of the tops in the industry. These women are paving the way for aspiring female business-women and entrepreneurs. These are some of their inspiring journeys.</p>
                <h3>Founder of 4D Healthcare: Star Cunningham</h3>
                <p>A platform that helps patients track their chronic pain conditions through devices and sensors. And this information can be shared with their healthcare providers. The founder of this incredible company, Star Cunningham, was initially an IBM executive where she used to build tech solutions for Fortune 500 clients. She had no role in healthcare, but her personal experiences helped her shape and build this company. She left IBM and used her expertise and knowledge to correct the dysfunctional healthcare system. She suffered from multiple chronic health conditions before and has witnessed several gaps in the healthcare system, including a lack of focused consumer solutions. While she has her health in control because she has access to good western medicine and healthcare and has the knowledge and skills of doing this, she wanted to create a solution that is dynamic, patient-friendly and extremely flexible. She started with ten employees and has now built an empire of her own.</p>
                 <p><img src="./img/articles/startup_html_d3311a1fb341cf1d.jpg" class="first" alt="a1"></p>                                              
                <p>   Currently, 4D Healthcare is also providing screening tests and treatment for the Covid-19 pandemic. They have tablets with data and provide medical devices as needed. They are using technology to hopefully be one step ahead of the virus at a time.</p>
                <h2>Co-founder of MobiKwik: Upasana Taku</h3>
                <p>After finishing her schooling in Surat, Upasana went on to study BTech in the National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar. Further, she went on to study at Stanford University. Her immense experience in the Payment and Financial services are what led her to her ultimate destination, that is MobiKwik. She first worked at HSBC San Diego and later she worked at PayPal. Even though she was very successful and one of the tops in the industry, she decided that she stopped wanting to be a corporate drone. She had worked on some high impact projects dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars, but the work was not satisfactory. She then came back to India and started discussing the idea that the idea of an online wallet, which was a relatively new concept here. Almost as a chance of fate, she met her husband Bipin through a mutual friend who helped her bring the idea to reality. Initially, she created "Zaakpay" which was a payment gateway, but with the help of Bipin, she started MobiKwik-- the semi-closed mobile wallet. They hired their first employee in 2010 and worked from their home, and within a year, they managed to get an office of 5 rooms with 25 employees. They received large fundings over the years and had 35 million users in just seven years. This may seem like an instant success story, but she faced a lot of hurdles.</p>
                <p><img src="./img/articles/startup_html_8be1dbc557858a76.jpg" class="first" alt="a2"></p>
                <p> Her passion for technology and the finance industry is what kept her going. Currently serving 150 million users, shes determined to stay focussed and continue with her work.</p>
                <h3>Founder of Blendoor: Stephanie Lampkin</h3>
                <p>Stephanie Lampkin had a degree in management science and engineering and had held several engineering positions. Yet when she applied for a job as a data analyst in a major tech company, she received a sales position instead. As a gay black woman, she felt the reason for this was extreme prejudice. It was almost as if she was born to solve this issue.</p>
                <p><img src="./img/articles/startup_html_e2a9920577f846a9.jpg" class="first" alt="a3"></p>
                <p> Blendoor’s mission is to change the way people think of other peoples’ orientations while hiring them for a job. Several redundant factors play a large role for an applicant while applying for a job. Some of these include—gender, race, your origin country and so on. As primitive as this sounds, it can hurt your chances of a recruiter looking at your resume.  </p>
                <p>So she sat down and created a platform that hides the candidate’s names and photos during the initial selection process so that the choice can be made on pure merit. Blendoor uses data analytics and machine learning to do this. It uses data sets that integrate performance metrics, reviews and achievements to find a capable candidate.</p>
                <h3>Founder of Zivame: Richa Kar</h3>
                <p>The entrepreneurial journey of Richa Kar was not exactly a smooth one as her parents opposed her from the beginning. They were embarrassed about the idea of their daughter opening an online lingerie store. But Richa was still determined to achieve her goal. Initially, she was a graduate from BITS Pilani and had a corporate job in Bangalore. The idea struck her when she was working in SAP and tracking the sales figures of Victorias Secret, Americas largest retail company of women'slingerie. She realised that there was no such market for Indian women. Since she had eight years in retail, she had a fair knowledge about the sector to start something of her own. She had to face an immense amount of difficulties as people would often make fun of her for her venture. Even when her landlord asked her what she did for a living, she just said that she sold clothes online.         </p>
                <p><img src="./img/articles/startup_html_e9415861a5bf9038.jpg" class="first" alt="a4"></p>
                <p>Women often feel very uncomfortable buying lingerie online because several of the shopkeepers are men. Despite all the difficulties she faced, she launched her brand in 2011, which she made with all her savings and borrowed money. Investors were so impressed with her dedication that she received her first funding of 3 million dollars in May 2012. And 40 million dollars in 2015. Currently, Zivame claims growth of 300% per year, and her company valuation is more than 681 crores.</p>
                <h3>Founder of audEERING: Dagmar Schuller</h3>
                <p>As a teenager, she was very interested in neural networks and genetic algorithms. Even though these technologies were not as prevalent then, she believed that AI had the potential to grow. She was initially from Syria but moved to Vienna because  she wanted to learn subjects like “process control and computer network” and “applied data technology.”</p>
                <p><img src="./img/articles/startup_html_e429b694393824c0.jpg" class="first" alt="a5"></p>
                <p>She has been working on (emotional) artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data for more than ten years. AudEERING is the lead innovator in the field of AI-based intelligent audio analysis. It filters out thousands of different features from just seconds of audio material. It provides information about the emotion, state and environment of the audio. This means that it analyses how someone says something. Not just what they say. </p>
                <p>She has learned seven programming languages, including C++ and Assembler, which is a machine language. She often speaks at events on the subject of artificial intelligence, and she wants to promote a positive attitude towards it and innovation. Her goal is to make AI accessible to everyone in their everyday lives in a meaningful and responsible manner. She also is a huge promoter of women in tech and encourages them to push boundaries, and focus on their goals.</p>
